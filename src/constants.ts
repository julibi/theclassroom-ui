      "This is a literary role play project, where you use NFTs to contribute to the story. The story frame is given: we are in the future and an AI led company called TheRetreat conducts space retreats for patients. There are 10 characters (some human and some not) and depending on which NFT you have, you can continue the story form their perspective. You can use an NFT to write only once.",

    question: "What can I do with this NFT?",
    answer:
      "You mint to write in a collaborative literature project. That means: you can use the NFT to continue the story as a certain character and write a text from their perspective. There is a total of 1000 NFTs and each NFT can be used once to write. If you log in to the app with your browser wallet, you will see for which characters you can write with your NFTs. E.G. you have TheRetreat NFT #1234, you will be able to write for the character with the ID #4. If you have #1235, you will be able to write for the character with the ID #5. The 10 characters will be released soon.",
